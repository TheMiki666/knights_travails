Exercise Knights Travails from the Ruby course of The Odin Project

# Assignment
Your task is to build a function knight_moves that shows the shortest possible way to get from one square to another by outputting all squares the knight will stop on along the way.

You can think of the board as having 2-dimensional coordinates. Your function would therefore look like:

knight_moves([0,0],[1,2]) == [[0,0],[1,2]]

Sometimes there is more than one fastest path. Examples of this are shown below. Any answer is correct as long as it follows the rules and gives the shortest possible path.

knight_moves([0,0],[3,3]) == [[0,0],[2,1],[3,3]] or knight_moves([0,0],[3,3]) == [[0,0],[1,2],[3,3]]
